# hapi-Mile

Is a proof of concept/sandbox web application that I am creating as an excuse to explore an idea that I have, along with the excuse of learning the hapi.js framework. You know what? ...while I am at it might as well take advantage of this and try to get familiar with a few other technologies that I may have not had much exposure to. The main objective is to learn some new stuff, and possibly make something useful.

# Objectives

Every project needs some kind of objective, so lets make a little list to keep me focused on an end goal. One of the main objectives of this project is to use new technologies that I haven't gotten much mileage with. Everything I was able to dive into would be added to the list of [Technologies Used](#technologies-used). 
While the technologies that I would like to spend more time with, and am yet to implement are going to the [To Be Used](#technologies-to-be-used) list until I find somewhere to put them.

Okay but what am I going to create? 
This is where things get a little bit hairy because not certain what I want to do with this app, I think that the idea is to make a car log / car diary application where you keep track of important events in a car's life using the odomoter and a date when the event occured. Lets say it's some kind of tell all version of a CarFax. Cars are one of the few pieces of technology that we keep for over 11 years according to the [US Beareau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_26.html).

## More on the App

This single page React application with; home page, user profile page, car profile page ,and useful user stats section in the about page of the site. Going to create two [User Stories](#user-stories) or narratives for the site to predict how users would use the site.

## Going to use the following technologies:

## Ingredients for this hapi-Mile Soup

- [ ] Node.js *duh*
- [ ] Firebase Realtime DB *its so fast for simple data*
- [ ] Firebase Authentication *it might be easier than passport*
- [ ] hapi.js framework *cause that's what they use at work, oh and v17 is crazy*
- [ ] Mocha / Chai for TDD *I need to write me some test yo*
- [ ] Docker *maybe*
- [ ] React *it originally was handlebars, but I upped the ante*
- [ ] Redis *not sure about this*
- [ ] Use two APIs *other than the firebase things*
- [ ] Use Service Workers *so that I could prompt users to update site*
- [ ] Use a Promise (*I think it will happen naturally*)
- [ ] Use a Callback (*I think it will happen naturally*)

## Technologies Used

These are some of the technologies that I have been able to integrate into this project. For more details about these technologies go [here](./docs/TECHUSED.md).

## Technologies To Be Used

I would like to try to implement the use of [these](./docs/TRYTHESE.md) technologies listed here, but I haven't been able to get there yet.

## User Stories

To go into detail about the two user case scenarios that I would like to use going to make a different .md file for this [here](./docs/USERSTORY.md).

I must have gotten the information to create this from somewhere, right? Consider this my references section.
