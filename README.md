# hapi-ness
This is a sandbox application so that I can get to know the hapi.js framework, while I am at it I am going to take advantage of this and try to get familiar with a few other technologies that I may have had much exposure to. The main objective is to learn some new stuff.

# Objectives
Every project needs some objectives, so lets make a little list to keep me focused on some kind of end goal. As I reach these so called goals, 
I would add them to the list of [Technologies Used](#technologies-used). 
While the ones that I am yet to conquor are going to be, well...they go in the [To Be Used](#technologies-to-be-used) list until I find somewhere to put them.

- [ ] Node.js *duh*
- [ ] Firebase Realtime DB
- [ ] Firebase Authentication
- [ ] hapi.js framework
- [ ] Mocha / Chai for TDD
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Handlebars
- [ ] Redis
- [ ] Use two APIs
- [ ] Use Service Workers
- [ ] Use a Promise (*I think it will happen naturally*)
- [ ] Use a Callback (*I think it will happen naturally*)



## Technologies Used
These are some of the technologies that I have been able to integrate into this project. For more details about these technologies go [here](../TECHUSED.md).

## Technologies To Be Used
I would like to try to implement the use of [these](../TRYTHESE.md) technologies listed here, but I haven't been able to get there yet.

Below are a few resources that I used to make this happen.
